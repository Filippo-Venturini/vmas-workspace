# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning of Swarm Behaviors with Graph Neural Networks

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the implementation of a system designed to train a swarm of autonomous agents and enable them to learn various swarming behaviors.

Training is accomplished through a custom implementation of the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm and the design of a Graph Neural Network (GNN).

## Running the Simulations

To run the simulations, clone the repository and execute the desired test scripts found in the */tests/* directory.
